# neovim-files
These are my neovim dotfiles.

## Requirements
lua, neovim(as recent as possible), git, and a nerd font.
* Node is semi-required.

* Lua is needed for the actual configuration files as well as the plugin manage.
* The plugin manager relies on git too.
* A nerd font is needed to display certain icons correctly.
* Npm is used for installing language servers if you're not using mason. It's not required if you already have the servers you need.
## Installation
```bash
git clone github.com/Jonte-P/neovim-files ~/.config/nvim
```
